     # yt2gif.app Testing Checklist
     ## Pre-Testing Setup
     ### Environment Setup
     - [ ] Ensure FFmpeg is installed on your system
     - [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in basic values
     - [ ] Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
     - [ ] Run `npm run db:generate && npm run db:push` to set up database
     - [ ] Start development server with `npm run dev`

● Perfect! I've created a comprehensive testing checklist for you. Here's my recommended testing approach:

  Quick Start Testing Strategy

  1. Begin with Basic Functionality (15 mins)

  Start here to ensure the core app works:
  - Run the setup commands in "Pre-Testing Setup"
  - Test the YouTube URL input with a simple video
  - Try the complete flow: URL → Preview → Range Selection → GIF Generation

  2. Core User Flows (30 mins)

  Test the main user journeys:
  - Free user: Create a GIF without account
  - Account creation and login
  - Premium upgrade simulation (using Stripe test mode)

  3. Mobile Responsiveness (20 mins)

  - Open browser dev tools
  - Test different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Try touch interactions on mobile simulation

  4. Error Handling (15 mins)

  - Test invalid YouTube URLs
  - Try network disconnection during processing
  - Test form validation with invalid inputs

  Priority Testing Order

  High Priority (Must Work):
  - Basic GIF generation from YouTube URL
  - User authentication (sign up/sign in)
  - Responsive design on mobile
  - Error handling for common scenarios

  Medium Priority:
  - Payment flow (Stripe test mode)
  - Premium features
  - Performance optimization
  - Cross-browser compatibility

  Low Priority:
  - Advanced edge cases
  - Accessibility features
  - SEO validation
  - Analytics tracking

  Quick Test Commands

  # Setup (run once)
  cp .env.example .env.local
  npm install
  npm run db:generate && npm run db:push

  # Start testing
  npm run dev

  # Build verification
  npm run build
  npm run type-check
  npm run lint

  Common Issues to Watch For

  1. FFmpeg not installed - You'll get video processing errors
  2. Missing environment variables - Authentication won't work
  3. Database connection issues - User features will fail
  4. CORS errors - YouTube integration might fail

  The checklist covers everything comprehensively, but focus on the core functionality first. If the basic YouTube-to-GIF
  conversion works, the foundation is solid!
